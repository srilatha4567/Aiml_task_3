Objective: To analyze data patterns, detect outliers, and identify key features using Python. 
Visual InsightsHistograms: Showed data distribution and skewness
Count Plots: Identified category frequency and class imbalances
Box Plots: Detected outliers that could distort model accuracy
Heatmaps: Revealed correlations; identified Multicollinearity where features were too similar ($r > 0.9$).

EDA: Initial "data check" to find patterns and errors.
Correlation: How much two variables change together
Outliers: Extreme values that mislead statistical averages
Multicollinearity: When variables are redundant, confusing the model
Visualization: Essential for making complex data easy to see and explain.
